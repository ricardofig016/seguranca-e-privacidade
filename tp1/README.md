# Performance Benchmarking of Cryptographic Mechanisms

First assignment for "Security and Privacy".

## Overview

Measurement of the performance of AES, RSA, and SHA cryptographic mechanisms in processing files of different sizes.

## Phases

### A. Generate random text files (in bytes)

- **AES file sizes**: 8, 64, 512, 4096, 32768, 262144, 2097152
- **SHA file sizes**: 8, 64, 512, 4096, 32768, 262144, 2097152
- **RSA file sizes**: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128

### B. Encrypt and Decrypt Files Using AES

### C. Measure RSA Encryption and Decryption Time

### D. Measure SHA-256 Hash Generation Time

### E. Prepare a Report

## Usage

```
/bin/python3 main.py
```
