# Performance Benchmarking of Cryptographic Mechanisms

First assignment for "Security and Privacy".

## Overview

Measurement of the performance of AES, RSA, and SHA cryptographic mechanisms in processing files of different sizes.

## Phases

- A. Generate random text files (in bytes)
- B. Encrypt and Decrypt Files Using AES
- C. Measure RSA Encryption and Decryption Time
- D. Measure SHA-256 Hash Generation Time
- E. Prepare a Report

## Usage

```
/bin/python3 main.py
```
